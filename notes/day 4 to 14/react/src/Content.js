      Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.
      His parents hailed from Lwali village in Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and he was the youngest of three children.[5][6][7] 
      His family spells the surname as "Dhauni".[8] The spelling "Dhoni" emerged due to a spelling mistake in his school certificates 
      and, despite repeated attempts by his family, has never been rectified.[9]

      Dhoni did his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir where he started playing football as a goal keeper but later moved to play 
      cricket on the suggestion of his coach Keshav Banerjee.[10][11] From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner
      (TTE) at Kharagpur under South Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways.[12][13]

       Early career
       He played as a wicket-keeper for Commando cricket club from 1995 to 1998 and Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team in 1998.[14] At CCL,
       he batted higher up the order and helped the team qualify to the higher division.[15] Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked 
       for the 1997/98 season of Vinoo Mankad Trophy under-16 championship.[16][17] In the 1998–99, Dhoni played for Bihar U-19 team in the Cooch Behar Trophy 
       and scored 176 runs in 5 matches. In the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni made 84 in a losing cause.
       Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 00488 runs in nine matches with five fifties, 17 catches and seven stumpings.[19] Dhoni made it to the East Zone
       U-19 squad for the C. K. Nayudu Trophy in the 1999–2000 season and scored only 97 runs in four matches, as East Zone lost all the matches and finished last in 
       the tournament.[20][21]
