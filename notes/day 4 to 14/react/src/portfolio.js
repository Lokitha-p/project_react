            Waste Management:
                In today's fast-paced and environmentally conscious world, efficient waste management is more critical than ever.
                As urban populations grow and the volume of waste increases, traditional waste collection methods struggle to keep up,
                often leading to missed pickups, improper disposal, and environmental degradation. To address these challenges, 
                we introduce an innovative solution: a house-to-house waste collection service powered by a user-friendly mobile app.
